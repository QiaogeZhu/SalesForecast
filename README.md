# Walmart Weekly Sales Forecast

This project is going to forecase weekly sales on the data given by Kaggle competition Walmart Sales Forecast.   
The modules being used in the following are:  
- pandas,numpy for data structure
- seaborn,matplotlib for data visualization  
- sklearn for data modeling   

There will be four main parts in the project:  
- Data loading
- Data exploration (data visualization to explore distributions of data)  
- Data preprocessing 
    - handling missing values  
    - correcting possible incorrect data values  
    - data merging 
    - feature engineering
- Data modeling    
    - data scaling
    - data dimensional reduction 
    - modeling
      - Linear Regression   
      - Lasso
      - Random Forest   
      - Gradient Boosing Regression  
      - Light GBM
 
Our goal for the project is not to predict the weekly sales reaching the most accurate in the world (sure that we will try our best to get as much accurate as we can), but to utilize our knowledges of data science so far and current sensitivity of data, and to implement any learned methods on data. The project is expected to be complete and logical but not to be perfect and unbeatable.
